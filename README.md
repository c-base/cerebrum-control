# cerebrum-control is a server to connect old control panels to the internet

It is intended to be used together with cerebrum-firmware (which runs on an arduino). The actual logic lives in sinatra/. driver.rb runs a server exposing the driver features (currently implemented: getting, setting, flashing leds) via json-rpc and rest. ledpcap.rb exposes the LED API via UDP (so you can set/unset/blink LEDs by sending shit to certain ports via UDP). server.rb currently is work in progress and is supposed to provide a webinterface where one can set "subscriptions", that is certain events upon which a LED is flashed or set. Currently implemented sources are twitter events ("watch for a user/hashtag/keyword") and web site monitor events ("watch for a keyword appearing on this web site")
